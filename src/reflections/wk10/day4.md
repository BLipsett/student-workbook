## What is an Enum, and what are some use cases for them?
- Strongly typed constants stored as value type data. They can be used as lists to refer to their values 

## How can you modify an Enum?
- You can set the first item in your enum = to 1. The rest will ascend from there.

## How have you used Enums in your afternoon lab projects this far?(if you have not yet, give an example of how you could)
- Enums could have been used in a console application for a rock paper scissors we built to store values and then compare for a win lose or tie case.
