## What are the three ways to syntactically write a function? What are the differences in how the function acts (if any)?

- function declaratiion ( allows the function to be hoiseted and used before its defined). Expression (can be named or anonymous. These functions are not hoisted and can set the function object to a variable). Arrow (a function expression that is syntactically shorter but loses the ability to use the "this" keyword within it).

## What is the difference between Parameters and Arguments?

- Parameters are the placeholders in a function to be used with different values passed in to them. Those values when passed in are the arguments.

## What are higher order functions? Can you provide an example?

- A higher order function is a function that takes in a function as an argument. More code may be abstracting and reused by passing in the functions as arguments throughout the project.
