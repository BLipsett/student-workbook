### What problems does the Observer Pattern seek to solve?

- Creates reusable code that can be used between many data binding events

### What are the three mechanisms of the observer pattern?

- Subscribe, Unsubscribe, Broadcast

### Review the code generated from the bcw-template and reflect on the proxy objects from yesterday, and your understanding of the observer pattern today. With this knowledge, explain how the magic of the bcw-template uses these two concepts to manage and update the dom.

- Using the oberver pattern we can continually update the DOM with multiple events and functions. The Proxy is there is there to keep everything in check along the way so the state of our objects is what we want it to be
