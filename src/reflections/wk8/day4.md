### What are the three main types of testing we can accomplish in Vue? What does each method provide?
- Unit testing. Component testing. End-to-end testing

### What testing method do you think is the most useful? Why?
- End to end is the complete tesing method. It can validate front and back end code in a streamlined process.

### What testing method do you think is the least useful? Why?
- Component testing. I think many components are tested somewhat thoroughly just while in development mode.
