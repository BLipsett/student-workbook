# What is the purpose of wire-framing?

- wire-framing provides visualization for the current project at hand. It can give directive for personal work or for an entire team.

# What are the different levels of detail in wire-frames and why is each one useful?

- It may only be necessary to have a rough layout for a web page to get a project started or it may require more detail if there is more invested that project.

# Do you think wire-frames are worth the Time, Energy, and Effort that they require? Why or Why not?

- I personally find wireframes to be very useful. They can use as much or as little time as you believe they need .In the long term I think more time is made up from having a clearer vision of what needs to be accomplished than what the time spent on the wireframe.
